# mtsNFVS
An efficient method for exactly computing attractors of large-scale asynchronous Boolean networks

This work has been accepted by ACM-BCB 2022.

The current version is written in Java and includes some manual parts. We are porting our Java code into Python code as well as making our software fully-automated. All changes will be put in the same repository.

A supplementary document that uses a non-trivial ABN to illustrate mtsNFVS is preparing and will be uploaded there.
